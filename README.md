> Hello hello !

Welcome to my website source code !

I put a lot of love and effort in making this website and I hope you'll enjoy it.
I used Next.js with very little additionnal packages to :
- (1) have fun,
- (2) have a lot of control on how everything looks.

I hope you'll find usefull things in here !

Jut a bit of  ```npm install```, ```npm run dev``` should do the trick.

Enjoy :$
